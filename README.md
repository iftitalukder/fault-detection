# üîç ML Model Evaluator from CSV

This repository provides a **plug-and-play Python script** to automatically train, evaluate, and compare multiple machine learning classifiers using a labeled CSV dataset. It outputs performance metrics, confusion matrices, and trained models ‚Äì all saved for reproducibility.

## ‚úÖ What This Repo Does

Given any classification dataset in CSV format, this tool:

- Loads and splits the dataset
- Trains the following models:
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - LightGBM
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Evaluates using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
- Saves:
  - Performance scores to CSV
  - Confusion matrices as PNGs
  - Trained models (`.pkl` files)

---

## üí° Why Use This?

This project is ideal for:

- Rapid benchmarking of classification models
- Academic or industry research pipelines
- Fault diagnosis, signal classification, or any supervised ML task with labeled CSV data
- Users who want **automation** without writing boilerplate code
